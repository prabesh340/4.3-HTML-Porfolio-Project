<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Prabesh Panta, a passionate learner and a tech enthusiast. I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in
  Computer Science, and I am deeply immersed in the world of programming, ethical hacking, and web development. My
  journey is all about blending creativity and technology to solve real-world problems and craft user-friendly
  solutions.</p>

<p>When I am not coding or exploring new frameworks, I enjoy delving into Linux systems and experimenting with
  open-source tools. My daily grind often includes optimizing workflows, tinkering with React, and enhancing my
  Chromebook Linux environment to meet my needs. I take pride in achieving 100% success in the tasks I undertake
  because, for me, persistence and perfection go hand in hand.</p>

<p>Beyond the tech realm, I have a flair for learning languages, with Japanese being one of my current pursuits. Riding
  a motorbike is a new challenge I have embraced, and while I am still perfecting my skills in hilly terrains and
  figure-eights, I love the thrill of pushing my limits. In my downtime, you might find me indulging in culinary
  adventures, like preparing bitter melon, or working on creative projects that reflect my personality and style.</p>
